## 💡 What I Learned

- **Flexbox Basics:**  
  - Learned when to use Flexbox — for containers that need to arrange child elements in a single direction (either horizontally as a row or vertically as a column).  
  - Used `align-items` to align elements horizontally within a Flexbox.  
  - Discovered how `flex-direction` can be changed to create vertical (column) layouts instead of the default row layout.

- **CSS Hover Animations:**  
  - Implemented GIF reveals using the `:hover` CSS pseudo-class for interactive effects.

- **Gradients:**  
  - Applied **linear gradients** to the background using `background-image: linear-gradient(...)` to enhance visual appeal.
